# Project Euler 045 - Triangular, Pentagonal and Hexagonal

Triangle, Pentagonal and Hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae:

Triangle T<sub>n</sub>=n(n+1)/2 generates the numbers 1, 3, 6, 10, 15,...

Pentagonal P<sub>n</sub>=n(3n-1)/2 generates the numbers 1, 5, 12, 22, 35,..

Hexagonal H<sub>n</sub>=n(2n-1) generates the numbers 1, 6, 15, 28, 45,...

It can be verified that T<sub>285</sub> = P<sub>165</sub> = H<sub>143</sub> = 40755

Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.
